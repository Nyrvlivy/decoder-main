# Decoder

**This is a personal project for a challenge that consists of creating a message decoder using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## Structure

- **Visual:** The project has a basic HTML, CSS structure and also some features with JavaScript, aiming good concepts of UX/UI.
- **Functional:** The functionality consists in a decoder that converts the following characters:<br>
"a" for "ai"  <br>
"e" for "enter"  <br>
"i" for "imes"  <br>
"o" for "ober"  <br>
"u" for "ufat".

The script also has a function to copy the result text and a reverse-engineering to decode back the original message.
